Throughout my studies at Penn State, I've refined my skills in programming languages like Python, Java, and Bash. These skills have been invaluable, and I've used them to develop numerous projects that showcase my understanding of critical cybersecurity concepts.


##Projects:
**Packet Sniffer (Python):** Uses scapy to collect packets and display information such as the protocol, source IP address, and destination IP address

**Password Generator (Python):** Randomly generates a secure password

**Password Strength Checker (Python):** Receives a user-entered password and gives the user feedback on how to make it more secure. The password is checked for its length, complexity, and if it fits into a list of common passwords

**Port Scanner (Python):** Uses sys and socket to scan for open ports on the device, and if any are found, will display related information such as the port number, protocol, and name of the service
