As I develop new skills in cybersecurity, I've been putting them to the test in practice environments and CTFs. Websites like TryHackMe allow me to refine my skills and gain new ones in simulated real-world environments. 

I've written reports on my actions during my completion of these CTFs and practice environments to further my understanding of the actions I take and to prepare for writing real-world security reports. These reports provide in-depth explanations of my actions and screenshots to help illustrate the process.
